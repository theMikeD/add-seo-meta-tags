# Add SEO Meta Tags

This is a Wordpress Plugin that adds the <em>Description</em> and <em>Keywords</em> XHTML META tags to your site's front page, and to each post, static page, custom post type, and category archive. In addition, custom tags can be added both site-wide and per-page.

The META tags can be fully customized. 

Gutenburg/Block Editor is supported.
